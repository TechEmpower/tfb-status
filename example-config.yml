# This is an example configuration file for the tfb-status application.
#
# To create your own configuration file, start by copying this file and then
# modify whatever settings you want.  The structure of configuration files is
# defined by the following class:
#
#   src/main/java/tfb/status/bootstrap/ApplicationConfig.java
#
# Refer to that class for documentation about each of the available
# configuration settings.
#
# To run the tfb-status application with a custom configuration file, the first
# command-line argument for the application must be the path to that
# configuration file.
